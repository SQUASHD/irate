My dad bought a bunch of Nespresso&reg; capsules and wanted to keep track of which ones he liked and which ones he didn't.
I'm making this app for him to do just that. Limited in scope and functionality to start with – maybe I'll add
more features later.

## Update: 2023-05-07
Project is coming along nicely. React Server Components are a lot of fun, and NextJS server actions are pretty cool too.
Now to intercept image uploads from the form to the server and save them to a bucket. And of course basic rating functionality. MVP what?

## To-Do
- [x] List capsules w/ product info
- [x] Data persistence
- [x] Basic auth
- [x] Functionality to add other items – kinda, just need to make a more general input form
- [ ] Image/asset bucket
- [ ] Rating functionality

## Maybe Later
- Global rating
- Teams/Groups
