# iRate
My dad bought a bunch of Nespresso&reg; capsules and wanted to keep track of which ones he liked and which ones he didn't.
I'm making this app for him to do just that. Limited in scope and functionality to start with – maybe I'll add
more features later.

## Update: 2023-05-13
Now able to rate items. Now to implement some sort of user page and filter.
And try to employ some prefetching and caching strategies.

## To-Do
- [x] List capsules w/ product info
- [x] Data persistence
- [x] Basic auth
- [x] Functionality to add other items – kinda, just need to make a more general input form
- [x] Rating functionality
- [ ] Image/asset bucket

## Maybe Later
- Global rating
- Teams/Groups
