# iRate
iRate is a web application I've designed to help coffee lovers track and rate their favorite Nespresso&reg; capsules. The inspiration came from my dad's desire to keep a record of his preferred capsules, and I've developed this app to serve that purpose. As it stands, users can add and remove ratings for listed items. While the only category at the moment is Nespresso Capsules, I plan to expand the scope and functionality of iRate to include more categories in the future.

## Features

### Current
- **Rating System**: Users can add ratings for their favorite (or least favorite) items.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter capsules by whether they have rated them or not.
- **Data Persistence**: Ratings are stored for future reference.
- **Basic Authentication**: I've implemented a simple authentication system to help secure user data.
- **Favourites**: Users can mark their favourite items.
- **Categories**: Users can add new categories and items to the database.
- **User Page**: A personal space where users can view (and soon manage) their ratings and favourites
  - And more!

### In Development
- **Rating Preview**: I'm working on allowing users to see capsule ratings directly on item cards for quick comparisons.
- **Dashboard**: Let users more easily manage their ratings, favourites and items/categories they've added.

### Future Plans
- **Teams/Groups**: In the future, I'm considering adding functionality for users to create groups to share and compare their ratings.
