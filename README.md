# iRate
iRate is a web application I've designed to help coffee lovers track and rate their favorite Nespresso&reg; capsules. The inspiration came from my dad's desire to keep a record of his preferred capsules, and I've developed this app to serve that purpose. As it stands, users can add and remove ratings for listed items. While the only category at the moment is Nespresso Capsules, I plan to expand the scope and functionality of iRate to include more categories in the future.

## Features

### Current
- **Capsule Catalog**: Users can browse through a near comprehensive list of Nespresso capsules with detailed product information.
- **Rating System**: Users can add ratings for their favorite (or least favorite) capsules.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter capsules by whether they have rated them or not.
- **Data Persistence**: Ratings are stored for future reference.
- **Basic Authentication**: I've implemented a simple authentication system to help secure user data.

### In Development
- **User Page**: A personal space where users can view and manage their ratings.
- **Rating Preview**: I'm working on allowing users to see capsule ratings directly on item cards for quick comparisons.

### Future Plans
- **Teams/Groups**: In the future, I'm considering adding functionality for users to create groups to share and compare their ratings.
- **Favourites**: A feature to let users mark their favourite items.
- **More Categories**: More categories with appropriate generic formatting
