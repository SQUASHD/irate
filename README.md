My dad bought a bunch of Nespresso&reg; capsules and wanted to keep track of which ones he liked and which ones he didn't.
I'm making this app for him to do just that. Limited in scope and functionality to start with â€“ maybe I'll add
more features later.

## To-Do
- [ ] List capsules w/ product info
- [ ] Image/asset bucket
- [ ] Data persistence
- [ ] Rating functionality
- [ ] Basic auth


## Maybe Later
- Functionality to add other items
- Global rating
- Teams/Groups
